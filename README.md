## Intro

One of the fastest ways to start processing payments with Paysafe is using Paysafe.js, a JavaScript SDK allowing you full control over the UX while still qualifying for SAQ-A, the simplest PCI complience level. In this repository we've provided a sample application for the end-user facing part of your checkout, the part where you collect the payment details.

Note that you still require server-side code to complete the transaction. See an example [here](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/sdks/paysafejs/card-payment-with-token/) or refer to the full [Cards API](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/payments/cards/api/) reference.


## Installation

You need Node.js to run the sample application

## Run

Run `npm start` in the project directory. This will start a small HTTP server on port 8080, point your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the demo
